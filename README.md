# Project Name

Volk Task Tracker

## Description

This is my task list tracker which allows users to input thier tasks and enter the following information which is stored in a PostgreSQL database
    - ID (Automatically created, no user interaction)
    - Task Name
    - Due Date
    - Priority Level
    - Task Group (To allow grouping of similar tasks)


### 1. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine.
2. **Create Database**: Create a new database for your to-do list app.
3. **Design Database Schema**: Plan your tables. For a to-do list, you might need a table for users (if you're including user functionality) and a table for tasks.
4. **Create Tables**: Use SQL commands to create your tables with the necessary fields (e.g., task_id, description, due_date, completed, user_id).

### 2. Backend Setup (Node.js & Express)
1. **Initialize Node.js Project**: Create a new folder for your project and initialize it with `npm init`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary NPM packages: `express` for your server, `pg` for PostgreSQL interaction, and others like `body-parser`, `cors`, `dotenv`.
3. **Set Up Express Server**: Write the code to start an Express server.
4. **Database Connection**: Write a script to connect to your PostgreSQL database using the `pg` module.
5. **Create API Endpoints**: Implement RESTful API endpoints (CRUD operations): create a task, read tasks, update a task, and delete a task.
6. **Middleware**: Add necessary middleware for body parsing, CORS, etc.
7. **Testing API**: Test your API using tools like Postman or Insomnia to ensure it's handling requests correctly.

### 3. Frontend Setup (React, HTML, CSS)
1. **Create React App**: Use `create-react-app` to bootstrap a new React project.
2. **Develop Components**: Build React components for your application (e.g., TaskList, TaskItem, AddTaskForm).
3. **State Management**: Manage state in your components for tasks, inputs, etc.
4. **Styling**: Use CSS or a CSS framework to style your components.
5. **Interact with Backend**: Use `fetch` or `axios` to connect your frontend to your backend API. Implement functions to retrieve tasks, add a new task, edit an existing task, and delete a task.
6. **Frontend Routing**: If necessary, set up routing using React Router for different views (e.g., home, about).

### 4. Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for both your backend and frontend.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the application as a whole to ensure that the frontend and backend work together as expected.

### 5. Deployment
1. **Prepare for Deployment**: Build your React app for production.
2. **Choose a Host**: Select hosting services for both the frontend (like Netlify, Vercel) and the backend (like Heroku, AWS).
3. **Deploy Backend**: Deploy your Node.js app to the chosen host. Set up environment variables for database connections and other sensitive data.
4. **Deploy Frontend**: Deploy your frontend code to a separate hosting service.

### 6. Maintenance and Updates
1. **Monitor Performance**: Check your application's performance and fix any issues.
2. **Update as Needed**: Regularly update the application with improvements or new features.
